A long, long time ago an old woman and an old man lived in a quiet life in a small cottage by the river. One day the woman decided to make a gingerbreak man for them to eat.

They unfortunately didnt know how to bake, so they ended up eating raw eggs. They then all got very sick and were sad. Thankfully, they went to a doctor and got all better. 

Eventually the old woman died. In the old man's sadness, he decided to visit the far away lands that they had always dreamed of. So he filled his house with balloons and 

flew off to adventure.
